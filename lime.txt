Limes are small, green citrus fruits known for their tart, tangy flavor, similar to but more
intense than lemons. They have a thin, green rind and juicy, segmented flesh inside. Limes are
rich in vitamin C, antioxidants, and other beneficial nutrients, making them a valuable
ingredient in both culinary and medicinal contexts.

Limes are commonly used to add acidity and brightness to dishes and drinks. They are a key
ingredient in many recipes, including salsas, marinades, cocktails like margaritas, and 
desserts like key lime pie. The zest of lime is also used to impart a citrusy aroma and 
flavor to various dishes.

In addition to their culinary uses, limes are known for their health benefits, such as 
boosting the immune system, improving skin health, and aiding digestion. They are also used in
traditional medicine for their antibacterial and antiviral properties.

In a fictional story, limes could symbolize freshness, zest, or a sharp twist in the narrative.
Their vibrant green color and bold flavor might also represent energy, renewal, or a burst of
creativity.
