Lemons are a vibrant yellow citrus fruit known for their sour, tangy flavor. They are
oval-shaped with a thick, textured rind and are packed with vitamin C, antioxidants, and other
beneficial compounds. Lemons are widely used in cooking and baking, often to add acidity and
brightness to dishes. The juice, zest, and even the rind of lemons can be used in a variety of
ways, from enhancing savory dishes to creating refreshing beverages like lemonade.

Lemons are also commonly used as a natural preservative and are a key ingredient in many
marinades, dressings, and sauces. Their tart flavor makes them a popular choice for balancing
sweetness in desserts and for adding a zesty kick to a wide range of recipes.

In terms of health benefits, lemons are known for their immune-boosting properties,
aiding in digestion, and promoting healthy skin. The high vitamin C content helps fight off
colds and supports overall well-being.
