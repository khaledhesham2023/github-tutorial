Tomatoes are a versatile and widely used fruit, though often considered a vegetable in culinary contexts. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, from small cherry tomatoes to large beefsteak varieties.
Tomatoes are rich in vitamins C and K, potassium, and antioxidants like lycopene, which is linked to various health benefits.
Tomatoes are commonly used in salads, sauces, soups, and as a base for many dishes. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or processed into products like ketchup, tomato paste, and juice. The flavor of a tomato can range from sweet to tangy,
depending on the variety and ripeness.
