Oranges are a popular citrus fruit known for their sweet and tangy flavor.
They are round, with a thick, orange-colored rind that is often peeled away to reveal juicy,
segmented flesh inside. Oranges are rich in vitamin C, fiber, and various antioxidants,
making them a healthy snack and a key ingredient in many recipes.

Oranges can be eaten fresh, juiced, or used in a wide variety of dishes, including salads,
desserts, and savory dishes. The zest of the orange rind is also commonly used to add flavor
to baked goods and sauces. There are several varieties of oranges, such as navel, Valencia,
and blood oranges, each with its own unique taste and characteristics.

Oranges are also known for their health benefits,
including supporting the immune system, improving skin health, and reducing the risk of
chronic diseases due to their high antioxidant content.
